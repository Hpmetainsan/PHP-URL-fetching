# URL QUERY TOOL 
This is one of my little web tools, which allows you to launch URL requests, very classic with features like:

1.**Modify User-Agent**

2.**Enable or Block SSL certificate verification** 

3.**Block or Enable tracking redirects**

4.**Define the maximum number of redirections to perform**

5.**View request headers**

6.**View source code**

This tool can be useful to you if you host it somewhere.
and you want for example to check some on a target, you can use the tool to perform very basic queries.
